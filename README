	First Execise: The aim of the exercise was to make a program that given a file, and two numbers n and s, would print n unique strings from the file each one with the size s. The end of the lines should be ignored and replaced by a space.
	
	Second Exercise: The aim of the exercise was to make a program that given n files with the extension of .txt would convert them to .epub (using multiple processes in parallel) and in addition to that it would create a zip containing all the epub files. We used pandoc (we assumed that it would be installed in the tester's machine) to do this exercice.
	
	Third Exercise: The aim of this exercice was to make a program that given two integers n and t and a decimal value p, would be able to create a ring of n interconnected processes joined by named pipes. These processes needed to be able to communicate unidirectionaly, by sending a token (an integer that starts with the value 0). When each process receives the token, it increments it, holds it for t seconds with a probability of p, and sends it to the next process. To do this exercice we assumed that the initial process would be part of the process ring.
